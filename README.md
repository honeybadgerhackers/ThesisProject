### __Installation__

This project uses PostgreSQL for it's database so you will need to host one prior to installing. 

#### Getting the Servers Started
The quickest way to get the server up and running is to use Docker-Compose. There is an example docker-compose.yml in the docs folder. You will need to fill in the environmental variables with your own project's information. Run `docker-compose pull` from the directory with your docker-compose.yml, then `docker-compose up -d` to start the server, and you should be good to go.

If you need to make modifications to the servers and want to keep using Docker, you will need to fork the repos and add them to your own docker hub account. 
### Hosting Without Docker
To run the app without docker, you will need to clone and start each of these repositories with the environmental variables listed. Once cloned with the environmental variables in place, each respective server's modules can be installed with `npm install` and started with `npm start`.
